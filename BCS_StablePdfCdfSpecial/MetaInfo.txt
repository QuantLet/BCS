Description: 'The code below plots the pdfs and cdfs for three special cases
              of the stable distribution for which the pdf and cdf have a
              closed form expression. The special cases are the normal,
              Cauchy and Levy distribution. Normal distributions have a
              kurtosis of three and zero skewness. The Cauchy distribution
              is symmetric around its mean but has thicker tails than the
              normal distribution. Random variables with a Levy distribution
              have a skewness which tends to one. Only variables which are
              above the mean will be observed.'
