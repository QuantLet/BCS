Description:              'Multiple Gaussian kernel regressions for DAX log-returns on FTSE
                           log-returns. The bandwidth is alternated to see the effect of
                           the bandwidth for the regression results. The smootheness of
                           the regression line increases with a higher bandwidth. This
                           causes a smaller bias but a higher variance.'

Output:                   'One plot for multiple kernel regressions of the DAX log-returns on FTSE
                           log-returns. Different regression lines correspond to different
