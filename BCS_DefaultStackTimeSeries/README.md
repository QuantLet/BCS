Name of Quantlet:       'BCS_DefaultStackTimeSeries'

Published in:           'Basic Elements of Computational Statistics'

Description:            'Time series datasets are easily plotted with lattice. Here the
                         dataset Nile is used to illustrate the usage of the package for
                         time series data. The plots show the annual flow of the river
                         Nile from 1871 to 1970. The first plot depicts the whole series
                         and the second plot splits the series into three intervals,
                         where each interval is one panel.'

Keywords:               'trellis, lattice, time, time series, plot, multivariate, continuous, 
                         default, Cut-and-stack time series plot, Default time series plot'

### R Code
```r

# make sure the package is installed install.packages('lattice')
library("lattice")
graphics.off()

# Time series plot
plot1 = xyplot(Nile)

# Time series cut-and-stack plots for further documentation see ?xyplot()
plot2 = xyplot(Nile, aspect = "xy", cut = list(number = 3, overlap = 0.1), strip = strip.custom(bg = "yellow", fg = "lightblue"))

# plots both graphs
print(plot1, position = c(0, 0, 1, 1), split = c(1, 1, 2, 1), more = TRUE)
print(plot2, position = c(0, 0, 1, 1), split = c(2, 1, 2, 1), more = TRUE)
