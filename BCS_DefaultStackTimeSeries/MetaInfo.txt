Description: 'Time series datasets are easily plotted with lattice. Here the
              dataset Nile is used to illustrate the usage of the package for
              time series data. The plots show the annual flow of the river
              Nile from 1871 to 1970. The first plot depicts the whole series
              and the second plot splits the series into three intervals,
              where each interval is one panel.'
