Description:             'Analysis of principal component analysis (PCA) in order 
                          to identify the efficient number of principal components.
                          The first three PCs are plotted against each other. 
                          Another plot shows the cumulative percentage variance against 
                          the number of components.'

Keywords:                'dimension-reduction, pca, plot, principal-components, visualization'
