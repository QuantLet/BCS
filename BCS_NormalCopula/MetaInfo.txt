Description: 'A bivariate normal distribution is created by the function
              normalCopula.The normalCopula function creates copula objects
              and also computes joint densities and probabilities. Both rv
              have a correlation of 0.7. The first plot is a standard
              scatterplot of the two variables. A contour and three dimensional
              scatterplot illustrate the cdf of the two variables. The last
              two plots depict the density functions for the rvs.
              One can observe the elliptical shape of the contour lines.'
