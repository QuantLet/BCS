Published in:              'Basic Elements of Computational Statistics'

Description:               'A bivariate normal distribution is created by the function
                            normalCopula.The normalCopula function creates copula objects
                            and also computes joint densities and probabilities. Both rv
                            have a correlation of 0.7. The first plot is a standard
                            scatterplot of the two variables. A contour and three dimensional
                            scatterplot illustrate the cdf of the two variables. The last
                            two plots depict the density functions for the rvs.
                            One can observe the elliptical shape of the contour lines.'
