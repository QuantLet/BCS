Description: 'The HAC package is used to create a random sample. The
              distribution is created iteratively. First the bivariate
              marginal distribution is created for the variables, which have
              a higher correlation. In the second step the bivariate marginal
              distribution is stacked together with the remaining variable.
              The actual observations are obtained, by using the quantile
              function of the respective marginal distribution. The
              trivariate distribution is plotted in a three dimensional
              scatterplot with its bivariate marginal distributions.'
