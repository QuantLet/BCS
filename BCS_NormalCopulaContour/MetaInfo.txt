Description: 'The trivariate normal distribution is produced by random sampling.
              In order to specify the dependency between the variables, it
              is necessary to define the covariance matrix. The mean vector
              for all three variables is also needed. The bivariate marginal
              distributions are estimated by copulae.'

Output: 'Bivariate marginal distributions are plotted in the upper
         triangle of the matrix. Contour plots for the densities in the
         lower triangle.'
