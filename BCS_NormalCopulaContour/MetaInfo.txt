Description:                  'The trivariate normal distribution is produced by random sampling.
                               In order to specify the dependency between the variables, it
                               is necessary to define the covariance matrix. The mean vector
                               for all three variables is also needed. The bivariate marginal
                               distributions are estimated by copulae.'

Output:                       'Bivariate marginal distributions are plotted in the upper
                               triangle of the matrix. Contour plots for the densities in the
                               lower triangle.'
