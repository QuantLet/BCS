Description:              'A 3d plot for the function: 
                           z = 0.03*sin(x)*sin(y) - 0.05*sin(2*x)*sin(y)
                           + 0.01*sin(x)*sin(2*y) + 0.09*sin(2*x)*sin(2*xy).
                           All maxima are depicted by blue points and all minima by red
                           points. The function is used to illstrate algotithms in R to
                           find roots of multivariate functions. Here the BFGS method is
                           used to find the optima.'
