Description: 'A function is implemented to use all four different kernel
              weighting functions to compute the respective weight of a point
              x w.r.t. its distance to the point of evaluation x_0. Four
              plots are created to illustrate each weighting functions and
              their properties.'

Keywords: 'kernel,bandwidth,weights,density estimation,plot,nonparametric,
           kernel density estimation'
