Description: 'Three dimensional interactive scatterplot for unemployment
              regressed on the number of armed forces and the GNP.
              The data belongs to the longley dataset. A hyperplane for the
              regression results shows a negative realtionship between
              umemployment and the number of armed forces. The increase in
              GNP is associated wih higher unemployment this is odd.'
