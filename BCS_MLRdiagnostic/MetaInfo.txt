Description: 'Perform multiple linear regression (MLR) on the dataset
              "UScereal" from package "MASS" and construct four diagnostic plots. These
              show first the residual errors plotted against their fitted values to check
              for a distinct trend. The second plot shows spread-location to detect skewness.
              The third plot is a QQ plot to check the deviation from the theoretical distribution
              of the errors. The fourth plot shows each points leverage.'
