Description: 'Two random variables are created. One is normally distributed
              and one is uniformly distributed. Their correlations are
              calculated with different methods. Kendall and Spearman''s
              methods are superior to Pearson''s correlation measure. Both
              are less variant due to monotone increasing transformations
              and outliers.'

Output: 'Two plots for the approximation of a uniformly distributed  rv by
         a normally distributed rv. One with no outlier and one with outlier.'
