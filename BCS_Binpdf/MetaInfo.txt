Description:               'The binomial distribution is plotted for sample sizes 5, 10
                            and 100 and probabilities 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9. The plots show nicely the shape
                            of the pdf for the different values and show when it can likely be
                            approximated by the normal distribution.'
