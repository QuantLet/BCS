Description:                  'Multiple unform kernel regressions for DAX log-returns on FTSE
                               log-returns. The bandwidth is alternated to see the effect of
                               the bandwidth for the regression results. The smootheness of
                               the regression line increases with a higher bandwidth. This
                               causes a smaller bias but a higher variance.'
