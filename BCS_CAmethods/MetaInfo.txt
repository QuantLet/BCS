Description: 'Perform a cluster analysis using single, complete and average linkage
              algorithms on the
              data set "agriculture" from the package "cluster". The three resulting dendrograms
              are plotted to show the divergence in the results.'

Keywords: 'plot, cluster, analysis, average linkage, dendrograms'
