Description:                'This code shows how to create different shapes with random
                             numbers in R. Six different objects are created with six
                             different functions. Each function uses variables as
                             coordinates for the shapes created.'

Keywords:                   'points, lines, linestrips, triangles, plot, quads, spheres, random,
                             normal, random numbers, 3D, trellis, lattice, rgl'
