Description: 'The distribution of solar radiation and average ozone
              concentration depending on wind and temperature is depicted in
              the plot. The two continous conditioning variables are
              transformed into factors. Wind has now just four categories
              and Temeperature three. There are 12 possible combination of
              both factors coinciding with the number of panels.'
