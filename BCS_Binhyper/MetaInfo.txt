Description:            'Two plots of the probability functions of the hypergeometric
                         distribution (plotted as lines) vs. the binomial distribution (plotted as dots).
                         The binomial distribution is a limiting form of the hypergeometric distribution,
                         for sample sizes much smaller than population size. In that case, the binomial
                         distribution can be used to approximate the hypergeometric distribution.'

Keywords:               'approximation, binomial, distribution, plot, visualization'
