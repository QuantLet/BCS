Name of Quantlet: 'BCS_rp.tkrplot'

Published in: 'Basic Elements of Computational Statistics'

Description: 'The rpanel package employs different graphical user interface (GUI) controls
              to enable the immediate communication with the graphical output and provides
              dynamic graphics. The rp.tkrplot function uses the tkrplot package and
              enables to place a plot and its control panel in a single window. In this
              example a density plot with a control for altering the bandwidth is drawn.'
