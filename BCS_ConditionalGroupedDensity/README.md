Name of Quantlet:        'BCS_ConditionalGroupedDensity'

Published in:            'Basic Elements of Computational Statistics'

Description:             'The plots for the density of a conditional or grouped variable
                          are for the used data the same. In this case it is preferable
                          to use the same variable as a group variable. R
                          produces one panel with the densities for the different
                          groups, which are drawn with different lines. Therefore a
                          direct comparison of the different groups is possible. In this
                          example the dependency of weight and the food of chickens is
                          illustrated.'

Keywords:                'lattice,grouped,conditional,panel,plot,variable,multivariate,
                          data,plot,density'

Submitted:               '2016-01-28, Christoph Schult'


Output:                  'Two plots for the densities of the weight of chickens with Feed as
                          conditioning (left) and grouping (right) variable.'

### R Code
```r

# make sure the package is installed install.packages('lattice')
require(lattice)

# Conditional density plots for chickwts dataset Chicken weights are plotted conditioned on their food.
denweight = densityplot(~weight | feed, data = chickwts, plot.points = F, scales = list(alternating = 1), ylab = "Density")

# Grouped superposed density plots(chickwts)
denweight2 = densityplot(~weight, data = chickwts, groups = feed, plot.points = F, auto.key = list(columns = 3), ylab = "Density")
graphics.off()
# Black and white settings

lattice.options(default.theme = modifyList(standard.theme(color = FALSE), list(strip.background = list(col = "transparent"))))

# displaying more than one graph at once
print(denweight, position = c(0, 0, 1, 1), split = c(1, 1, 2, 1), more = TRUE)  # Feed as conditional variable
print(denweight2, position = c(0, 0, 1, 1), split = c(2, 1, 2, 1), more = TRUE)  # Feed as grouped variable

# to set the color scheme to default
