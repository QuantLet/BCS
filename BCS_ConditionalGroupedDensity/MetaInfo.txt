Published in: 'Basic Elements of Computational Statistics'

Description: 'The plots for the density of a conditional or grouped variable
              are for the used data the same. In this case it is preferable
              to use the same variable as a group variable. R
              produces one panel with the densities for the different
              groups, which are drawn with different lines. Therefore a
              direct comparison of the different groups is possible. In this
              example the dependency of weight and the food of chickens is
              illustrated.'
