Description:                     'Histogram of R example data nhtemp with manual choice of grids.
                                  A manual choice of grid is necessary, for example, for small samples, since
                                  R''s default way of calculation is based on the Sturges formula, which performs
                                  poorly for n < 30. Histograms are commonly used to visualize data frequencies of
                                  continous variables.'

Keywords:                        'histogram, plot, visualization, grid, frequencies, data'
