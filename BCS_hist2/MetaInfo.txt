Description: 'Histogram of R example data nhtemp with manual choice of grids.
              A manual choice of grid is necessary, for example, for small samples, since
              R's default way of calculation is based on the Sturges formula, which performs
              poorly for n<30. Histograms are commonly used to visualize data frequencies of
              continous variables.'

Keywords: 'histogram, plot, visualization, grid, frequencies, data'
