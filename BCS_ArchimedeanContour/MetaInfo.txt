Published in: 'Basic Elements of Computational Statistics'

Description: 'Nine Plots are created for three different archimedean
              copulae with the same dependency parameter (theta=2). The figures
              in the left column are created based on normal marginal
              distributions. In the right column all copulae are based on a
              t-distribution with six degrees of freedom.
              The rows depict the Gumbel, Clayton and Frank copulae in
              descending order.'
