Description:                 'Different lighted plots for three dimensional data. The data
                              is obtained by univariate random normal sampling. Light
                              sources are then alternated for the different plots to show the
                              effect on the appearance of the plot.'

Keywords:                    'rgl, lighted, plot, random normal, normal, 3D, marbles'
