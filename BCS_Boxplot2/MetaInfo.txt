Description: 'Boxplot of R example dataset Nile and manual calculation and
              notation of important values. The notation on the axes is
              calculated manually, giving a nice example of the calcuation of a five
              number summary, on which the box-plot is based. Note that R by default
              draws the whiskers to the highest/lowest value in the sample which is
              still in the upper-/lower fence.'

Keywords: 'boxplot, Nile, data visualization, outlier detection, histogram'
