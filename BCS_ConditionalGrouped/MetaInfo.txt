Description: 'The plots for a conditional or grouped variable differ, even if
              you use the same variable. The left plot has three
              panels for the types of Species and contains four different
              combinations of iris characteristics. This plot corresponds to
              Species as a conditioning variable. Species as a grouping
              variable produces the right plot. Here four panels are created,
              which differ by combinations of variables and types of species.'
