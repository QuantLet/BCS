Description: 'The rpanel package employs different graphical user interface (GUI) controls
              to enable the immediate communication with the graphical output and provides
              dynamic graphics. In this example the rp.listbox function is presented. The
              function adds a list of items to the control panel. Selecting an item calls
              an action function and modifies the graphical output accordingly. In this
              case rp.listbox is used to switch between a histogram and a boxplot.'
