Description: 'Pie Chart of chickwts$feed depicting the shares of different
              feed types. It is a common technique for qualitative or discreet variables.
              Since the human brain does not distinguish as easily between angles and
              shapes as it does between lengths, bar diagrams and bar plots are preferred.'

Keywords: 'plot, visualization, pie, chart, graphical visualization'
