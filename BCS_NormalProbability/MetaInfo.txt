Description: 'The code creates two graphics. One graphic is a scatterplot of
              the bivariate normal cumulative distribution. Contours are plotted to
              illustrate for which combinations of the two variables the
              probability is the same. You can call them alo isolines.
              The other plot is a 3 dimensional scatterplot, which shows
              the specific value of the joint pdf.'
