Description:                  'The code creates two graphics. One graphic is a scatterplot of
                               the bivariate normal cumulative distribution. Contours are plotted to
                               illustrate for which combinations of the two variables the
                               probability is the same. You can call them alo isolines.
                               The other plot is a 3 dimensional scatterplot, which shows
                               the specific value of the joint pdf.'
