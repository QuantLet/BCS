Description: 'Implementation of the Lagged Fibonacci Generator (LFG) for
              random numbers. The seed is a sequence of j integers, of which
              one integer should be odd. The value of the modulus is 2^l and j and k
              denote the number of lags. Resulting from the use of the Fibonacci Sequence,
              the generated sequences do not have satisfactory randomness properties.'

Keywords: 'Fibonacci, lagged, generator, random, plot'
