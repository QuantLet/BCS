Description:             'Graphic of the probability mass function of the poission distribution vs.
                          binomial distribution. The binomial is given by bars, while the binomial distr.
                          is plotted as dots. It can be seen that the poisson as well as the binomial
                          distribution closely approache the binomial distribution for the specified values.'

Keywords:                'approximation, binomial, distribution, plot, poisson, visualization'
