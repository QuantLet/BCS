Description: 'Multiple spline regressions for DAX log-returns on FTSE
              log-returns. The lambda is alternated to see the effect of
              lambda for the regression results. The smootheness of
              the regression line increases with a higher lambda. This
              causes a smaller bias but a higher variance.'

Output: 'One plot for multiple kernel regressions of the DAX log-returns on FTSE
         log-returns. Different regression lines correspond to different
         bandwiths.'
