Description: 'The bias, variance and mean squared error of an estimator for a histogram with
              origin x 0 = 0 evaluated at x = 0.001 and X ??? N(0,1) is depicted in the plot. The binwidth minimizing
              the MSE h MSE is depicted by a black point.'

Keywords: 'mse, mean squared error, bias, variance, nonparametric, plot,
