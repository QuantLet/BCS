Description:             'The normal distribution is very often applied in statisitics.
                          It is a stable distribution, which is symmetric around its
                          mean. The standard normal distribution has an expectaion of
                          zero and variance equals one. Higher variance leads to flatter
                          pdfs and cdfs.'

Keywords:                'continuous, standard, univariate, distribution, normal, pdf, cdf, 
                          stable, gauss, CLT, gaussian'

Output:                  'Plots pdfs and cdfs for normal distribution with different
                          standard deviations and zero expectation.'

```r

# creates the rv
z = seq(-15, 15, length = 400)
# different standard deviations
s = c(1, 3, 6)

# standard normal pdf

lines(z, dnorm(z, 0, s[2]), col = "green")
# s=6
lines(z, dnorm(z, 0, s[3]), col = "blue")

# same order of s as above standard normal cdf
