Description: 'Multiple kNN regressions for DAX log-returns on FTSE
              log-returns. The selection of nearest neighbours k is
              alternated to see the effect of k for the regression curves.
              The smootheness of regression line is less smooth with a smaller k.
              This causes a smaller bias but a higher variance.'

Keywords: 'kNN,regression,DAX,FTSE,log-returns,estimation,plot,
           nonparametric,univariate nonparametric regression,uniform,
           nearest neighbours,different number of nearest neighbours'

Output: 'One plot for multiple kNN regressions of the DAX log-returns on FTSE
         log-returns. Different regression lines correspond to different
         k.'
