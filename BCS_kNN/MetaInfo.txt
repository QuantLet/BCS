Description:                     'Multiple kNN regressions for DAX log-returns on FTSE
                                  log-returns. The selection of nearest neighbours k is
                                  alternated to see the effect of k for the regression curves.
                                  The smoothness of regression line is less smooth with a smaller k.
                                  This causes a smaller bias but a higher variance.'
