Description:           'A 3d plot for the function z = (1/3) * x^3 * (1/4) * y^4,
                        which is the integral of its first derivative with respect to
                        both function arguments. Both arguments are in the interval
                        [0, 1]. The function wireframe included in the lattice package
                        is used.'
