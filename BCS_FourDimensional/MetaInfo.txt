Description:               'The datset barley contains yield data from Minnesota. Average
                            yield is plotted depnding on where it is planted (site) and
                            which variety is used. The third conditioning variable is time
                            creating two panels. Higher average yield is associated with
                            greater and lighter rectangles. Therefore four variables are
                            illustrated in one graph (yield, time, variety, site).'

                            conditioning variables.'
