Description: 'The datset barley contains yield data from Minnesota. Average
              yield is plotted depnding on where it is planted (site) and
              which variety is used. The third conditioning variable is time
              creating two panels. Higher average yield is associated with
              greater and lighter rectangles. Therefore four variables are
              illustrated in one graph (yield, time, variety, site).'
